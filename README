# Translate CDS to Protein FASTA

## Overview
This Python script translates coding sequences (CDS) from a FASTA file into protein sequences. The script supports **command-line arguments** for input/output files and includes **tab completion** for file selection.

## Features
- Reads **CDS sequences** from a FASTA file.
- Translates the sequences into **protein sequences**.
- Writes the **protein sequences** to an output FASTA file.
- Supports **tab completion** for file selection.
- Uses **Biopython** for sequence processing.

## Requirements
Ensure you have **Python 3** installed. Check your Python version:

```bash
python3 --version
```

### Install Dependencies
Install the required Python libraries using:

```bash
pip install biopython argparse glob pyreadline3
```

For **Linux/macOS**, `readline` is pre-installed. For **Windows**, you may need:

```bash
pip install pyreadline3
```

## Installation
Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/translate-cds.git
cd translate-cds
```

Make the script executable (optional on Linux/macOS):

```bash
chmod +x translate_cds.py
```

## Usage
Run the script from the command line:

```bash
python translate_cds.py -i input_cds.fa -o output_protein.fa
```

### **Example:**
```bash
python translate_cds.py -i cds.fa -o protein.fa
```

#### **Tab Completion for File Selection:**
If your file is named `cds.fa`, you can type:
```bash
python translate_cds.py -i c<TAB>
```
And it will auto-complete the filename.

## Troubleshooting
**1. `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'Bio'`**
   - Install Biopython using:
     ```bash
     pip install biopython
     ```

**2. Tab completion not working on Windows?**
   - Install `pyreadline3`:
     ```bash
     pip install pyreadline3
     ```
